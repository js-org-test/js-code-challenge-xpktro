## What should this webapp be able to do?

1. List the objects related by one degree to Luke Skywalker in `https://swapi.co/api/people/1`
2. Ignore list of URLs that have more than 5 links (to avoid exceeding the rate limit).
3. Use the [vis](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vis) library to show the relationships.
4. There should be a `loading...` message while we are fetching the resources.

- Feel free to use or stop using any other library you know, like `jQuery`, `lodash`, `underscore`, etc.
- Don't be afraid to add new features if you feel like it (but don't forget to document them).
